          <p>I am Troy Hinckley, an award-winning Audio/Video Production Specialist with over 35 years of experience in the industry. With a deep passion for storytelling, I have dedicated my career to crafting visually and emotionally compelling narratives that captivate audiences and leave a lasting impact.

            Throughout my career, I have worked on 70+ films, contributed to 8 IMAX productions, and produced over 2,500 corporate videos. My expertise spans the entire spectrum of film production—from scriptwriting and directing to cinematography, editing, color grading, and post-production sound design. I have been privileged to collaborate with some of the most talented professionals in the industry, refining my skills in high-pressure environments and delivering top-tier content that resonates with audiences worldwide.

            As a DaVinci Resolve Certified Colorist, I specialize in high-end color grading, ensuring that every frame tells a story with depth and emotion. My experience in post-production sound engineering has allowed me to create immersive auditory experiences, from dialogue editing and sound design to final mixing for major film and television projects.

          Over the years, my work has been recognized with multiple Telly Awards, Golden Eagle Awards, and nominations for Academy Awards in the documentary film category. Whether I’m producing short-form content, corporate videos, commercials, or feature-length films, my goal remains the same: to bring powerful stories to life through expert cinematography, editing, and sound design.

          I am always eager to collaborate on meaningful projects that push creative boundaries. If you’re looking for someone who can turn a vision into a compelling visual masterpiece, let’s connect!
